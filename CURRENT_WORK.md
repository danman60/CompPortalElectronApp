# Next Build — v2.4.4

## Bugs

1. **Big NEXT didn't start recording** — nextFull not triggering OBS record on advance
2. **VIEW column broken formatting** — layout issue in last table column
3. **Lower third needed browser reload after app update** — WS reconnect or state not pushed on connect

## UI Polish

4. **Version number in top bar** — greyed out, subtle
5. **Rename ENCODING → PROCESSING** — everywhere in UI
6. **Bigger lower third text** — 1.5x current sizing
7. **Date + seconds on clock overlay** — currently just H:MM AM/PM, add date and seconds

## Features

8. **Better encoded filenames** — TENANT/COMP/P_performance.mp4, J1_commentary.mp4 etc
9. **5 lower third animations** — slide, zoom, fade, sparkle, plus randomize option
